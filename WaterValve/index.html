            <a>
                The goal is to design a system that is capable of releasing chlorinated water into nearby bodies which would disinfect bodies of water. Collabroating within a team of three, we designed, tested and developed the two prototypes below using Soild-Works. The prototypes had to be temperature, water, and stress resistant insuring it can efficiently close and open with minimal leakage.

            <a>		The groupâ€™s print time in relation to its mass was right in the middle of the trendline for the class data for cylindrical valves as shown in Scatter Plot Figure revealing that it was an average print time. Additionally The two experimental data points for prototypes are compared against the theoretical combined temperature we wished to acheieve. Overall, the graph represents how well the experiments were performed. This compares the total volume of water and how it should affect the combined temperature.
