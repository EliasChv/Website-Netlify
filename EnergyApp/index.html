            <!-- Text 1 -->
            <a>Using Matlab, and thousands of data values for Nuclear, Fossil Fuel, Renewable and Hydroelectirc energy our team constructed an app to allow users to corss compare different energy usages in states. The ultimate goal for this project is to bring awareness to the sources different states get their energy from
                As well as to quantify the large scale usage and production of harmful fuels. The pontential users in mind for this app are Environmentalist, Students, Researchers, and Law Makers.</a>

            <a> A major takeaway from this project is that, their is still a  concerning amount of energy still being created by fossil fuels. While media portrays companies being clean all the time, it is still a very minute amount of clean energy.</a>
