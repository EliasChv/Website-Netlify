                <a>In this project, we are visualizing the specifications of the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), with an aim to determine the trend of technological advancement in the processing units throughout the years as well as explore the correlation between the specifications and compare the specifications of CPU and GPU.</a>
                <div style="border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; border-radius: 2px; margin-bottom: 15px;"></div>
                <div style="display: grid; gap: 10px; grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 200px 200px; justify-content: center;" id="images"></div>

                <a>Some observations that were concluded from the figures were clear cooperation between the decrease in process size and increase in die size of GPUs and CPUs and the development of higher-performance hardware. Also, we have found that there is plenty of development of GPUs with a large die size in order to fit the maximum amount of transistors in recent years. This leads to how there is an increasing demand for extremely high processing power, which could mainly be due to Artificial Intelligence needing tremendous computing power. Moreover, we concluded that it is harder to achieve a higher frequency with a large number of transistors on a processing unit. Additionally, the trends that we have found in our outputs point toward computer hardware becoming significantly more powerful and efficient than in previous years at a higher rate, with the increasing number of transistors and frequency, decreasing process size, and stagnant rate of increase for thermal design power.</a>
